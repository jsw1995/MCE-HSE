Image compression and meaningful ciphertext encryption based on histogram shift embedding

The min function can be run directly to realize encryption and decryption.

Modify the plaintext and cover paths in the following two lines of the program.

im = cv.imread('date/peppers_gray.tif', 0)

cover = cv.imread('date/woman.tif', 0)
